3DMapFi supports multiple map projections to fit your application's requirements.

## Supported Projections

### Mercator

The default projection, suitable for most web mapping applications. Preserves angles and shapes for small areas, but distorts size near the poles.

### Globe

A 3D globe view, ideal for global data visualization and immersive experiences.

### Custom Projections

You can define custom projections to match specific regional or scientific requirements. Refer to the API for supported custom projection parameters.

## Changing the Projection

You can set the projection when initializing the map or update it dynamically.

### Setting Projection on Initialization

You can specify the projection in the map constructor:

```js
const map = new Map({
  container: 'map',
  style: 'https://3dmapfi.xyz/styles/street.json',
  projection: 'globe', // or 'mercator', or a custom projection object
});
```

### Switching Projections Dynamically

Switch projections at runtime to provide different perspectives:

```js
// Switch to Mercator
map.setProjection('mercator');

// Switch to a custom projection
map.setProjection({
  name: 'lambertConformalConic',
  parallels: [33, 45],
  centralMeridian: -96
});
```

## Use Cases

- **Mercator**: Navigation, city maps, and most web mapping.
- **Globe**: Global data, flight paths, and educational tools.
- **Custom**: Regional maps, scientific visualization, or specialized cartography.

## Advanced Projection Features

### Projection Transitions

3DMapFi supports smooth animated transitions between projections for a seamless user experience.

```js
// Example: Animate transition to globe projection
map.setProjection('globe', { animate: true });
```

### Projection-Specific Layer Adjustments

Some layers may require adjustments or reconfiguration when switching projections. For example, symbol placement or label orientation may need to be updated for optimal readability.

```js
map.on('projectionchange', () => {
  // Update layer properties or re-calculate data as needed
});
```

### Combining Projections with Terrain

You can use projections in combination with 3D terrain for enhanced visualization:

```js
map.setProjection('globe');
map.setTerrain({ source: 'terrain-source', exaggeration: 2 });
```

## Troubleshooting

- If features appear distorted or misplaced after changing projections, verify your data source and layer configurations.
- Custom projections may require additional parameters; consult the API documentation for details.
- Some projections may not support all map features (e.g., certain 3D effects).
